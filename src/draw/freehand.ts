/**
 * Freehand stroke geometry for the brush and highlighter. Pure: points in,
 * points or path commands out, no DOM and no chart. Three jobs, in the order
 * a stroke meets them.
 *
 * - `rdpSimplify` thins a raw pointer trail. A drag reports a point every few
 *   px, so a two-second stroke arrives as hundreds of anchors that each cost a
 *   time/price conversion on every frame and a row in every save. Thinning
 *   keeps the shape within a pixel tolerance and drops the rest.
 * - `catmullRom` strokes what survives as a spline through the kept points,
 *   so thinning does not turn the ink into a polyline of visible corners.
 * - `pressureWidth` maps a pen's pressure onto a width around the tool's own,
 *   so a pen stroke swells and thins while a mouse, which reports 0.5, draws
 *   at the configured width.
