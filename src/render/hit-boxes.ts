/**
 * The hit-box prefilter a pane runs before asking its primitives to hit-test
 * (`IPrimitive.hitBounds`, `Pane.hitTestPrimitives`).
 *
 * A pointer move used to ask every primitive on the pane, and a pane can carry
 * hundreds: order lines, alerts, a host's annotations. A primitive that
 * declares a box is asked only when the point is inside it, and the boxes are
 * measured once and kept while nothing they depend on has changed, so a hover
 * over a still chart measures once rather than on every move.
 *
 * "Nothing has changed" is a key the pane reads afresh on every hit test:
 * the numbers and references a primitive's render context maps with, and two
 * counts standing for everything else. Any difference from the last reading
 * lets every kept box go.
 *
 * The pane reads it again after each frame it paints. A box measured while
 * the key differed from the last painted one was measured between a change
 * and the frame that shows it; a primitive that answers from what it last
 * drew has a box of the old frame then, so such boxes go at the next paint.
