/**
 * The render backend port (ARCHITECTURE.md section 3). A pane paints its series
 * through one of these and draws everything else (background, grid, primitives,
 * axes) on a 2D context itself, so a backend that rasterises series on the GPU
 * plugs in without the pane, the registry or any renderer learning about it.
 *
 * The port is deliberately narrow. It covers the one hot path a GPU can take
 * over, the per-frame series pass, and nothing the 2D context already does
 * well. Text, dashed lines, gradients and the drawing tools stay on canvas 2D.
 *
 * Which backend a chart gets is decided once, at construction, by the
 * `renderer` chart option or an injected factory. This module keeps the
 * registry that resolves the option; the shipped 2D backend registers itself
 * from its own module, and a later tier registers `webgl2` the same way, so
 * this file never has to import either.
