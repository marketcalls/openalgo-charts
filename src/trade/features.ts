 * The rule here is the opposite of the original capability flags. Those treat

 * before they existed must keep placing orders. Nothing written before this
 * file can carry an account, a duration or a close, so an omission here means
 * unsupported. A host that assumed otherwise would drop the field on the wire
 * and send the order somewhere the user did not choose, or dress an opposite
 * order up as a native close.
