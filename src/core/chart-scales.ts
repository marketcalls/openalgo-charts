/**
 * The price-scale logic behind the chart-wide and one-axis setters: the patch
 * a pane receives from a chart-wide setting, promoting a pane to quoting the
 * instrument, whether a legacy side swap can move an axis, measuring one scale
 * on demand, and the state a menu raised over one price axis reads.
 *
 * Its own module because these are the rules that decide which scales a
 * setting reaches, and they read nothing of the chart beyond what
 * `ScalesHost` names. The chart reaches it through `Chart._scales`, and it
 * reaches the chart through `ScalesHost`. The chart-wide defaults, the
 * formatter and the set of panes that quote the instrument stay on Chart,
 * because the panes and the series read them too. `priceAxisState` stays
 * public on Chart as a delegate and carries the documented contract.
 * `movePriceAxis` keeps its body on Chart: the deprecation policy test holds
 * `priceAxisMoved` to be emitted only inside a method that carries the
 * deprecation tag, and a method here would carry none. Members the chart
 * calls are public on this internal class; no entry point exports the class
 * and the chart holds it in a private field, so none of it reaches the
 * published declarations.
