/**
 * A pane is one vertically-stacked drawing region (price pane, volume pane,
 * indicator pane). It owns a base + top canvas (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.1) and a
 * price scale, and renders its series against the shared time scale + DataLayer.
 *
 * The canvas pile, bottom to top, and what lands on each:
 *
 *   base canvas (2D context, z 0): background, grid, the series pass, the
 *     normal-layer primitives, the axis strip (ladder, last-price tag, value
 *     tags, trading pills). Repainted on Light and Full.
 *   top canvas (2D context, z 1): crosshair, hover highlights, primitives
 *     being dragged. Repainted on Cursor.
 *
 * A GPU backend adds no canvas to the pile. It rasterises the series pass on
 * one page-wide offscreen surface shared by every pane of every chart and
 * blits the result into the base canvas at `endFrame`, between the grid and
 * the normal-layer primitives, exactly where the 2D backend would have
 * painted them. That is why the grid, the primitives, the axes and the
 * overlay keep painting on 2D contexts whatever the backend is, why
 * `takeScreenshot` and the export still read `base.element`, and why a
 * browser's cap on live WebGL contexts never limits how many panes a page
 * can show.
