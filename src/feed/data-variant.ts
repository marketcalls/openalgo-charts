/**
 * Data variants: which of a provider's series for one instrument a chart shows.
 *
 * Regular and extended session, adjusted and raw prices, and a quote currency
 * or unit are each a different series from the provider, not a view of one
 * series. Extended hours add bars that the regular series does not have, and
 * an adjusted history rewrites every price before a corporate action. So a
 * variant is identity, like the symbol: it is part of every request, every
 * cache key and every saved chart, and a change of variant is a change of
 * source.
 *
 * Nothing here converts, adjusts or filters bars. A variant is served by the
 * provider that declares it (`DataFeed.dataVariants`) or it is unsupported;
 * there is no local fallback, because a series derived here would look exactly
 * like the provider's own and be wrong in ways nobody could see.
