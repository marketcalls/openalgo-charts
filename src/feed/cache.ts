/**
 * Warm-load bar cache: a wrapper around ANY `DataFeed`, so a custom feed gets
 * the same behaviour as `OpenAlgoDataFeed`.
 *
 *     const feed = withBarCache(new OpenAlgoDataFeed(cfg), { ttlMs: 60_000 });
 *
 * The design decisions, all of which are load-bearing:
 *
 * **Key.** `symbol | exchange | interval`, then the data variant when the
 * request names one (extended hours, raw prices): each is a separate provider
 * series, and the default variant adds nothing, so keys written before
 * variants existed still match. The requested range is deliberately
 * NOT part of the key: one entry per series holds the widest set fetched so
 * far, and a narrower request is served by slicing it. Keying on the range
 * would miss on every pan and on every "same chart, one bar later" reload,
 * which is exactly the traffic warm-load is meant to remove.
 *
 * **Freshness.** Two independent gates, both of which must pass:
 *   1. `ttlMs` bounds absolute age.
 *   2. Nothing new can have closed. An entry is complete through `to`; the next
 *      bar closes at `to + 1 + intervalSec`, measured on the feed's own bar
 *      grid rather than on UTC midnight, so a daily Indian bar opening at 03:45
 *      UTC is judged against its own session, not against the wrong boundary.
 * The effect is what you want from a warm cache: a closed session stays usable
 * for the whole TTL, while a 1m chart is only reused inside the current minute.
 *
 * **The forming bar is never cached.** A bar whose close time is still in the
 * future keeps moving, and serving yesterday's snapshot of it to a live chart
 * is worse than not caching at all: the chart would paint a frozen candle and
 * have no way to know. So the trailing forming bar is dropped on store, and
 * coverage ends at the last CLOSED bar. A cache hit can therefore be short by
 * at most one bar, the one a live subscription re-supplies immediately, and is
 * never wrong about a bar it does return.
 *
 * **Bounds.** Capped on both entry count (`max`) and total cached bars
 * (`maxBars`), LRU-evicted. Entries alone do not bound memory (one intraday
 * series can be 100k bars); bar count is the honest proxy for bytes that can be
 * measured without serialising. Byte counting would mean stringifying every
 * entry on every write, which costs more than the cache saves.
 *
 * **Storage.** A bounded in-memory copy is always available. A host may inject
 * `storage` to persist through localStorage, IndexedDB, or another store, but
 * the engine will not choose one itself. Durable reads, writes, and deletes are
 * best effort so storage denial or quota exhaustion cannot block market data.
 * Store methods may return a promise. `CachedBars` is plain JSON so it
 * round-trips through `JSON.stringify` unchanged.
 *
 * **Opt-out.** `getBars({ ..., noCache: true })` always hits the network (and
 * refreshes the entry); `invalidate()` and `clear()` drop entries by hand.

 *  - **an unregistered code.** Guessing 60 seconds is how the old parser turned

 *
 * The caller must treat null as "cannot cache and cannot serve past coverage",
