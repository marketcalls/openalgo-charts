/**
 * OpenAlgo trade adapter (ARCHITECTURE.md §10.0). Implements the order engine's
 * OrderFeed over OpenAlgo REST (`/api/v1/placeorder`, `/modifyorder`,
 * `/cancelorder`) plus orderbook/positionbook fetches for reconciliation.
 *
 * Payloads match the local OpenAlgo docs: `placeorder` requires
 * strategy/symbol/action/exchange/pricetype/product/quantity; `modifyorder`
 * additionally requires the full order context, so we cache each order's context
 * (from place + the order book) and merge the patch on modify. Book responses
 * return string quantities/prices, which are decoded to numbers. Fetch is
 * injectable for offline tests; verify field names against your OpenAlgo build.
 *
 * Two guarantees live HERE rather than in `OrderEngine`, because the largest
 * consumer drives this class directly and never constructs the engine:
 *
 * - **Reading the book fails closed.** An unmappable enum or an unreadable
 *   number never becomes a tradable order. See `decodeOrder`.
 * - **The analyzer/live mode is checked, not claimed.** See `getServerMode`.
