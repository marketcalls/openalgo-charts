/**
 * The incremental path (`calcTail`) for the built-in studies, and the one rule
 * every one of them keeps: a tail spliced onto the previous result reads, value
 * for value, what a full `calc` of the same bars returns. Not close to it: the
 * same numbers, NaN and signed zero included, because a live chart shows the
 * spliced answer and a reload shows the full one, and a user comparing the two
 * must not find a difference.
 *
 * Two shapes cover the built-ins.
 *
 * A study whose value at a bar reads a bounded run of bars before it (a moving
 * window) runs its own `calc` over just that run. No second copy of the formula
 * exists to drift from the first.
 *
 * A study that carries state from bar to bar (an exponential average, a running
 * total, a stop and reverse) resumes from a checkpoint: the state after the bar
 * before the tail. The previous tail leaves it; after a full `calc`, which is
 * what runs on a load, a history change or a settings change, the first tail
 * rebuilds it once by walking the history from bar 0. Every later tick costs a
 * step or two.
 *
 * Either way the tail also recomputes the bar before it and compares that with
 * the result the runtime still holds. A disagreement means the held result is
 * not this study's own (a descriptor that spread a built-in and reshaped its
 * output) or the history moved under it, and the tail declines so the full
 * `calc` runs. A study that keeps disagreeing stops being offered the tail.
