/**
 * How a running study writes its plots (ARCHITECTURE.md §8): each plot series
 * gets only the points that moved since the last pass, in place.
 *
 * A study recomputes on every frame that carries a tick, and used to hand each
 * plot its whole history through `setData`: a new point per bar, a new bar per
 * point, a sort, and a re-merge of the chart's time index, per plot per tick.
 * A plot's times are the source's own, though, and a tick moves the value of
 * the forming bar and perhaps opens one more. So each plot keeps a record of
 * what its series holds, and a pass whose bars begin with the times the last
 * pass wrote sends the few points that differ through `update`. Anything else
 * (new history, a gap filled, a plot the pass before did not write, more than
 * `IN_PLACE` moved points, which new settings usually are) is a whole write
 * through `setData`, as before.
 *
 * The record is never output. Every pass computes every point afresh, colours
 * included, and compares it with the record, so the forming bar is written
 * whenever it moved and nothing a reader sees comes from the record (CLAUDE.md,
 * never cache the forming bar). A pass that stops part way leaves its records
 * stamped with the pass before, and the next pass writes those plots whole.
 * The record describes the series only while the study is its one writer,
 * which is why `IndicatorApi.series` hands a plot out for styling alone.
