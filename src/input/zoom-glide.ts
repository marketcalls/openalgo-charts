 *
 *   applied(t) = base + (target − base) · (1 − e^(−t/tau))
 *
 * The work is done in LOG space and the caller exponentiates the per-frame
 * delta, because zoom composes multiplicatively: two 1.1x steps are 1.21x, not
 * 1.2x. Easing the multiplier directly would make the first half of a glide
 * cover more zoom than the second, and a glide interrupted midway would land on
 * a different scale than one left alone.
 *
 * Closed form, so it is deterministic and unit-testable with no Date or rAF
 * inside: the caller samples {@link ZoomGlide.appliedAt} each frame and zooms by
 * the delta since its previous sample.
