# Interactions

*When to read this: wiring or rebinding keyboard shortcuts, changing crosshair behaviour, supporting touch, arming a placement gesture, or making the chart keyboard-accessible.*

Source of truth: `src/core/chart.ts` (`_attachInput` and the pointer/wheel/key handlers), `src/input/wheel.ts`, `src/input/shortcuts.ts`, `src/input/kinetic.ts`, `src/input/touch.ts`, `src/input/crosshair.ts`, `src/primitives/time-navigator.ts`. Tests: `tests/wheel-navigation.test.ts`, `tests/price-scale-transitions.test.ts`, `tests/shortcuts.test.ts`, `tests/interaction.test.ts`, `tests/pointer-button-guard.test.ts`, `tests/placement-mode.test.ts`, `tests/time-navigator.test.ts`.

Everything is built on Pointer Events, so mouse, touch and pen share one code path. Listeners are attached to the container in the constructor and removed in `destroy()`; `keydown` goes on `document` when available, else on the container.

## Pointer gestures

| Gesture | Effect | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Drag the plot | mouse, pen and touch pan time and price by default | `navigation.mousePan: 'horizontal'` limits mouse and pen to time; panning price switches the pressed pane to manual scaling, while horizontal-only panning preserves autoscale |
| Vertical wheel over the plot | zoom the time axis | proportional to normalized CSS-pixel distance, eased by default; `animZoom: false` applies instantly. `zoomAnchor` selects cursor x or right edge |
| Horizontal wheel, dominant x delta or Shift-wheel | pan time | Shift maps a vertical-only delta onto x; Ctrl-wheel and Meta-wheel remain pinch-style zoom input |
| Wheel over a price axis | scale that left or right price range | pointer price stays anchored and that one scale becomes manual |
| Drag either price axis | rescale price | `exp(dy * 0.005)` about the range centre, then `setAutoScale(false)` |
| Drag the time axis (bottom strip of the last pane) | left expands bar spacing; right compresses it | `barSpacing * exp(-dx * 0.005)`, preserving the logical right edge |
| Drag a pane divider | redistribute height between the two adjacent panes | grab tolerance 4 px, cursor `row-resize`, summed weight preserved, neither side below `min(24, total/4)` px; emits `paneResized` on release |
| Double-click | `doubleClick` option: `'reset'` (default) is `resetScale()`, the configured default view plus autoscale on every pane; `'maximize'` toggles `maximizePane` for the pane under the pointer; `'none'` only emits | suppressed while placement mode is on, or when a `dblclick` listener set `handled` on the event; the event carries `paneIndex`, `x`, `y` |
| Press on a draggable primitive | drags the line instead of panning | arms when `hit.draggable` is true, or `hit.cursor === 'ns-resize'` and `subscribeDrag` is registered |
| Flick and release | kinetic scroll | see below |
| Two pointers | pinch | see below |
| Right-click | composites the pane into the overlay so the browser's "Save image as…" is not blank, and freezes overlay repaints until the next input | skipped when the host called `preventDefault()` |

A press-and-release with under 3 px of movement is a click: `subscribeClick` fires for a hit, and the `click` event fires either way carrying `id`, `price`, `time`, `paneIndex` and `point`.

**Only the primary mouse button starts a gesture.** Both `pointerdown` and the native `pointerup` filter `e.pointerType === 'mouse' && e.button !== 0`. Without the pointerup half, a right-click replays the previous left-click against stale coordinates and fires a phantom order (`tests/pointer-button-guard.test.ts`). Touch and pen contact with button 0 and are unaffected.

`wheelPixels` converts DOM_DELTA_LINE to 16 CSS px and DOM_DELTA_PAGE to the chart
width or height. `wheelLogFactor` preserves a 1.1 zoom for a 100 px notch and scales
smaller input proportionally, clamped per event. A browser pinch reported as Ctrl-wheel
or Meta-wheel zooms at the pointer even when `zoomAnchor: 'right'` is configured.

**The wheel handler prevents default for non-zero normalized input.** A chart placed
inline in a scrolling page traps wheel movement while the pointer is over it; give it its
own scroll region when the page must retain wheel scrolling.

Kinetic scrolling: a release faster than `triggerSpeed` decelerates as `velocity(t) = v0 · e^(−k·t)`. `DEFAULT_KINETIC_OPTIONS` is `friction: 0.0055` (1/ms, larger stops sooner), `minSpeed: 0.02` px/ms (animation ends), `triggerSpeed: 0.08` px/ms (slower flicks ignored). `KineticAnimation` uses no `Date` or `rAF` internally, so it is deterministic; the next `pointerdown` cancels it.

Pinch: a second pointer aborts any single-pointer drag. Each frame compares two `pinchState` snapshots (`factor` (distance ratio) zooms time at the midpoint, `dx` pans time, `dy` pans the pinched pane's price scale) all in the same frame, so spreading while sliding zooms and pans at once.

## Autoscale motion and cancellation

`ChartOptions.animAutoscale` defaults to `animZoom` and eases an automatic price range
while time navigation reveals new extrema. The range interpolation works in linear,
logarithmic, percentage and indexed-to-100 modes. It does not override a manually panned
or scaled axis, or a fixed range.

Programmatic `setVisibleLogicalRange`, `fitContent`, `resetScale`, primary-series
`setData` and `destroy` stop pending navigation motion before applying their own state.
A new wheel tick folds its remaining zoom distance into the new target; a pointer press
cancels the zoom glide so the direct gesture owns the viewport. There is no promised
delay tied to realtime data, and browser or device event delivery may differ.

## Navigation options

```ts
createChart(el, { navigation: { mousePan: 'both', defaultVisibleBars: 120 } });
chart.setNavigationOptions({ mousePan: 'horizontal' }); // optional time-only panning
chart.navigationOptions();  // Readonly<ChartNavigationOptions>
```

`ChartNavigationOptions` is exported from the base entry. `mousePan` defaults to
`'both'` and applies to mouse and pen plot drags; touch retains two-axis panning.
Horizontal panning leaves autoscale enabled when it was enabled, so price can still
follow the newly visible bars.

`defaultVisibleBars` defaults to `0`, fitting all loaded bars. A positive count targets
the newest N loaded bars plus four empty bar slots on the right, within available-data
and bar-spacing limits. Initial data and `resetScale()` use this default, and changing
the count applies the default view immediately. `fitContent()` continues to fit all
loaded bars. The count changes no feed request and discards no history; an explicit host
viewport applied after loading data wins. The widget's ordinary load views honour the
configured count.

Both fields appear in the settings schema's Axes / Navigation group as
`navigation.mousePan` and `navigation.defaultVisibleBars`. `readChartSettings` /
`applyChartSettings` and `getState` / `restoreState` persist them. Upgrading preserves
explicit saved horizontal preferences. Select **Axes > Mouse drag > Time and price**
or set `mousePan: 'both'` to change that preference; do not reset unrelated user settings.

## Crosshair

```ts
createChart(el, { crosshairMode: 'magnet' });   // 'normal' is the default
chart.applyOptions({ crosshairMode: 'normal' }); // takes effect on the next pointer move
```

`magnetSnapPrice(price, bar)` returns whichever of `bar.open/high/low/close` is nearest.

**Magnet only snaps in the pane holding the first price series.** Volume and indicator panes are not price scales, so the snap is skipped there. `DrawingController`'s own `magnet` option is separate and snaps on pane 0 only.

**`CrosshairMode` is not exported by name.** Pass the string literals `'normal'` / `'magnet'`; the type is inlined into `dist/index.d.ts` but absent from the export list.

## Keyboard

On by default. `chart.shortcuts` is the `ShortcutManager`, or `null` when disabled with `shortcuts: false`.

### Default keymap

`DEFAULT_KEYMAP` in `src/input/shortcuts.ts`. `Mod` is Ctrl on Windows/Linux and Cmd on macOS.

| Command | Label | Default combos | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `panLeft` | Pan left | `ArrowLeft` | `rightOffset -= 2` |
| `panRight` | Pan right | `ArrowRight` | `rightOffset += 2` |
| `panLeftFast` | Pan left (fast) | `Mod+ArrowLeft` | `rightOffset -= 10` |
| `panRightFast` | Pan right (fast) | `Mod+ArrowRight` | `rightOffset += 10` |
| `panUp` | Pan up | `ArrowUp` | `panes[0].priceScale.panByPixels(20)` |
| `panDown` | Pan down | `ArrowDown` | `panes[0].priceScale.panByPixels(-20)` |
| `zoomIn` | Zoom in | `Equal`, `Shift+Equal`, `NumpadAdd` | `zoomAtX(width/2, 1.1)` |
| `zoomOut` | Zoom out | `Minus`, `NumpadSubtract` | `zoomAtX(width/2, 1/1.1)` |
| `resetScale` | Reset scale | `Home`, `Digit0` | `resetScale()` |
| `fitContent` | Fit content | `Alt+KeyF` | `timeScale.fitContent(length)` |
| `screenshot` | Screenshot (PNG) | `Alt+Shift+KeyS` | `downloadScreenshot()` |
| `toggleGridVert` | Toggle vertical grid | `Alt+KeyV` | flips `grid.vertLines` |
| `toggleGridHorz` | Toggle horizontal grid | `Alt+KeyH` | flips `grid.horzLines` |
| `toggleCrosshairMagnet` | Toggle crosshair magnet | `Alt+KeyM` | swaps `normal` / `magnet` |

`panLeftBar` and `panRightBar` (`rightOffset ∓ 1`) are executable commands with **no default binding**: they exist for the TimeNavigator buttons and for hosts that want a one-bar step. `BUILTIN_COMMANDS` is the set built from `DEFAULT_KEYMAP`, so it does not contain them.

`ALT_PRESET` overlays three: `panLeftFast: Alt+ArrowLeft`, `panRightFast: Alt+ArrowRight`, `screenshot: Mod+Shift+KeyS`. Select it with `preset: 'alt'` or `setPreset('alt')`; user rebinds still win.

**`panUp` and `panDown` always act on pane 0**, whatever pane the pointer is over.

### Combos

Physical key codes, so bindings survive keyboard layouts. Modifiers in canonical order `Mod`, `Ctrl`, `Meta`, `Alt`, `Shift`, joined with `+`, one non-modifier key last matching `[A-Za-z0-9]+` (`KeyR`, `Digit0`, `ArrowLeft`, `Home`, `Equal`, `Minus`, `NumpadAdd`, `Escape`, `Space`).

```ts
parseCombo('Shift+Mod+KeyA');   // { mods: ['Mod','Shift'], key: 'KeyA' }
normalizeCombo('Shift+Mod+KeyA'); // 'Mod+Shift+KeyA'  ('' when invalid)
isValidCombo('Alt+KeyR');       // true
isReservedCombo('Mod+KeyW');    // true
formatCombo('Alt+KeyR');        // 'Alt + R'; on macOS, the Option glyph U+2325 then 'R'
eventToCombo(keyboardEvent);    // 'Mod+ArrowLeft'
```

Reserved (never bindable): `Mod+KeyW/T/N/Q/R/L`, `Mod+Shift+KeyT/N/W`.

Scope: `hover` (default) fires only while the pointer is inside the chart or focus is on the container or a descendant, the right choice for a multi-chart page. `global` always fires. Keys are ignored whenever the event target is an `input`, `textarea`, `select`, or a `contenteditable` element (`ShortcutManager.shouldIgnore`).

### Configuring and rebinding

```ts
const chart = createChart(el, {
  shortcuts: {
    preset: 'alt',
    scope: 'global',
    overrides: { panLeftFast: 'Alt+ArrowLeft', screenshot: null }, // null unbinds, still listed
    disabledCommands: ['toggleCrosshairMagnet'],
    customShortcuts: [
      { command: 'openOrders', label: 'Open orders', combos: 'Alt+KeyO', onTrigger: () => openOrders() },
    ],
    persist: true,          // localStorage, key 'openalgo-charts:shortcuts'
  },
});

chart.shortcuts?.setBinding('zoomIn', 'Shift+Equal'); // false if reserved or all combos invalid
chart.shortcuts?.disable('panUp');
chart.shortcuts?.resetBinding('panUp');
chart.shortcuts?.resetAll();
chart.shortcuts?.list();   // [{ command, label, combos, isCustom, isDisabled }]
chart.shortcuts?.state();  // { preset, overrides, disabled }, serializable
chart.shortcuts?.on((e) => track(e.command)); // { command, combo, isCustom }; returns an unsubscribe
```

`shortcuts` also accepts a pre-built `ShortcutManager`, which is how two charts share one keymap.

**Persisted state overrides constructor options.** With `persist: true` the manager loads saved preset/overrides/disabled in the constructor and applies them on top of what you passed, so a stale localStorage entry silently wins. Bump `storageKey` when you change defaults.

**Reserved combos passed through `overrides` are dropped silently.** Only `setBinding` reports failure, by returning `false`.

**Disabling shortcuts does not disable the TimeNavigator buttons.** They call `_runShortcut` directly; with `shortcuts: false` they still zoom, reset and step, they just lose their keyboard-hint tooltips.

## Touch and mobile

The constructor sets `touch-action: none` on the container, so the browser does not steal pan or pinch. One finger pans both axes; two fingers pinch-zoom and pan; a double-tap raises the synthetic `dblclick` and resets the scale; a tap under 3 px of travel is a click and hit-tests primitives.

**A scrollable ancestor can still swallow touch before the chart sees it.** Put `touch-action: none` on the scroll container too, or move the chart out of the native-scroll region.

`window.devicePixelRatio` is read at startup and on every resize; override with `pixelRatio: () => 2` for fixed-density screenshots or headless environments.

The packaged widget adds responsive mobile chrome; the engine itself remains DOM-free.
See [widget](widget.md#mobile-controls) for the `'auto'`, `'always'` and `'never'` modes,
shared drawing state and reduced-motion defaults.

## Accessibility

The constructor makes the container a focusable, labelled region: `role="application"` (only when no `role` is set), `aria-label` from `ChartOptions.ariaLabel` (default `'Interactive financial chart'`, always set), `tabindex="0"` (only when no `tabindex` is set), plus a visually hidden `aria-live="polite"` div refreshed with the bar count and latest formatted close on data changes and on every handled shortcut.

```ts
createChart(el, { ariaLabel: 'NIFTY 5-minute candlestick chart' });
```

Keyboard-only navigation is complete: focus the container, then arrows pan, `=`/`-` zoom, `Home` or `0` resets, `Alt+F` fits. `destroy()` removes the live region and clears the cursor hint but leaves `role`, `aria-label` and `tabindex` on the element.

**`ariaLabel` is constructor-only.** There is no setter; call `container.setAttribute('aria-label', …)` when the symbol changes.

## Placement mode

```ts
chart.setPlacementMode(true);
```

While active: a press no longer pans, `dblclick` no longer resets the scale (so a variable-anchor tool can be finished with a double-click), and a press-drag-release is reported as **two** `click` events (the press point, then the release point tagged `viaDrag: true`) so a two-point shape is drawn in one gesture. A press-release that never moves more than 3 px stays a single click. Verified in `tests/placement-mode.test.ts`.

`DrawingController` drives this for you: `setTool(id)` turns it on, and clearing the tool, finishing a shape or destroying the controller turns it off. Call it directly only when building a placement UI that is not a drawing tool (an alert level, a custom annotation).

**Leaving placement mode on makes the chart un-pannable.** Always pair the `true` with a `false`.

## Time navigator

A hover-revealed control strip above the time axis, on by default. It is an ordinary primitive living on the bottom pane, re-parented when panes are added or removed.

```ts
createChart(el, { timeNavigator: false });
createChart(el, { timeNavigator: { size: 30, revealHeight: 90, fadeSeconds: 0.2, showTooltip: false } });
```

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `buttons` | `['zoomOut', 'zoomIn', null, 'resetScale', null, 'panLeftBar', 'panRightBar']` (`null` inserts a group gap) |
| `size` / `gap` / `groupGap` | `26` / `4` / `16` |
| `bottomMargin` / `revealHeight` | `10` / `64` |
| `fadeSeconds` | `0.12` (`0` disables the fade) |
| `showTooltip` / `id` | `true` / `'timenav'` |

Buttons run the same command ids the keyboard does, through `_runShortcut`, so the two paths cannot drift. Tooltip hints are read from the live keymap at construction, so a rebind of `zoomIn` shows in the tooltip; the one-bar step buttons have no default binding and therefore no hint.

`TimeNavigatorAction` includes `'resetScale'`. The centre button's default tooltip is
**Reset view**, with the `Home` keyboard hint. It restores `navigation.defaultVisibleBars`
and autoscale, through the same `resetScale()` action as the keyboard.

Reveal is driven by an explicit `setPointer(plotLocalPoint | null)` from the chart, not by hover ids, a drawing or order line near the bottom edge would otherwise win the hit test and hide the strip. While hidden the buttons hit-test to nothing, so they never steal a click.
