// One undo timeline per chart: studies, their settings, the chart type,
// price scales, panes and drawings, walked by Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y, the toolbar
// buttons, the rail and the mobile bar alike.
//
// The demo rebuilds its chart on every load and every chart-type switch, so
// the timeline is not the chart's: it lives on `app`, and each rebuilt chart
// is attached to it. A study keeps its id through the rebuild and a pane its
// slot, which is what the history follows, so the steps survive it. The
// chart type itself is a rebuild here, not something the engine can switch
// in place, so the demo records it as its own command.
//
// Three things the demo does to the chart are not the user's steps, and go
// through `withoutHistory`: comparisons (they own a temporary scale mode),
// the volume row (host settings) and a layout being loaded, which starts a
// new timeline instead.
