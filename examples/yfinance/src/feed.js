// through uncached, and a `from` that drifts by a second per call would miss
// on every single load.

// The forming bar never comes out of the cache. The wrapper drops the
// trailing bar whose close is still in the future when it stores a series,
// and serves a hit past its coverage only while the bar after its last
// closed one is still forming: so a warm load during market hours is short
// by exactly the forming bar, and never wrong about a bar it does return.
// That is the engine's guard (src/feed/cache.ts), exercised end to end by
// this page's own tests; the stale badge below is what tells the user the
// chart is a bar short, and the cache menu's reload is the remedy.
