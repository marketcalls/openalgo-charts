"""Dependency-light server for the yfinance demo.

Serves the package root statically and answers a JSON history endpoint, so
the browser demo and its data come from one origin and there is no CORS to
configure.

Usage:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python server.py                    # http://127.0.0.1:8000
    python server.py --port 8123        # another port (a bare 8123 works too)
    python server.py --fixture          # synthetic bars: no yfinance, no network
    python server.py --self-test        # run the built-in checks and exit

Then open:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/examples/yfinance/index.html

History endpoint:
    GET /api/history?symbol=AAPL&interval=1d&period=1y
    GET /api/history?symbol=AAPL&interval=5m&from=<utc_seconds>&to=<utc_seconds>
A success is the Bar array the chart consumes directly:
    [{ "time": <utc_seconds>, "open", "high", "low", "close", "volume" }, ...]

Quote and news endpoints, for the watchlist and news panels (fixture mode only):
    GET /api/quotes?symbols=AAPL,RELIANCE.NS
        [{ "symbol", "exchange", "last", "previousClose", "bid", "ask", "volume", "time" }, ...]
        An instrument the source does not know is left out, never answered with zeros.
    GET /api/news?symbol=AAPL&limit=20&cursor=<from the previous page>
        { "items": [{ "id", "headline", "source", "time", "summary", "url"? }], "nextCursor": <string or null> }
Without --fixture both answer 501 not_available: this server has no live quote
or news source, and a quote is never made up from the last bar.

A failure is { "error": <message>, "code": <token> } with the matching status:
    400 bad_symbol, bad_interval, bad_period, bad_range, bad_limit, bad_cursor
    404 no_data (the source has no bars for that ask), not_found (no such endpoint)
    429 rate_limited (the source is throttling; Retry-After says when to retry)
    501 not_available (quotes and news without --fixture)
    502 upstream_error (the source failed)
    503 not_installed (yfinance is missing and --fixture was not given)

Only the standard library and yfinance are used, and yfinance is imported on
the first real request, so static serving and --fixture work without it.
